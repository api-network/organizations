name: OpenID
description: <p>OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol.
  Promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation, it allows users to be authenticated
  by co-operating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party service,
  eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems, and
  allowing users to log into multiple unrelated websites without having to have a
  separate identity and password for each. Users create accounts by selecting an OpenID
  identity provider[1] and then use those accounts to sign onto any website that accepts
  OpenID authentication. Several large organizations either issue or accept OpenIDs
  on their websites, according to the OpenID Foundation.</p>
