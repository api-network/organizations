  of your stack. Locate and sync your dev stack across your entire team with a single
  click, and get valuable insights that allow you to choose the right code components
  for your projects. Gain instant access to your company&rsquo;s entire development
  stack through GitHub or any other version control repository. We map your code components,
  development tools and internal know-how within your organization, giving you visibility

  from our recommendation engine.&nbsp;</p>
