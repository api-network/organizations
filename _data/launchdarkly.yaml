description: <p>Our vision is to eliminate risk for developers and operations teams
  from the software development cycle. As companies transition to a world built on
  software, there is an increasing requirement to move quickly&mdash;but that often
  comes with the desire to maintain control. LaunchDarkly is the feature management
  platform that enables dev and ops teams to control the whole feature lifecycle,
  from concept to launch to value.&nbsp;</p>
