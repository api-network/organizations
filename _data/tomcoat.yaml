description: The RheoPower chemometrics software package is the fastest way to analyze
  and to simulate polymer structure and flows. It accelerates your material development
  and design of polymerization, extrusion, injection moulding processes down to microstructure
  analyzes. By RheoPower you do not get only MWD (Molecular Weight Distribution),
  but modelled different type polymer flows even impossible to measure.
