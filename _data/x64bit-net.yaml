description: |-
  Our site is dedicated but not limited to the x64bit operating system, and x64bit hardware. OS manufacturers like Microsoft have provided us with different x64 bit OS's, but the need is there to find compatible software, hardware and hardware drivers.
  Our mission goal is to provide members, guests, visitors, developers, and hardware/software manufacturers with the insight they need to develop,maintain, update and use 64bit software and hardware.
