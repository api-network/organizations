  as easy as it should be. We also know you need your data to be secured end-to-end.It&rsquo;s
  quick and easy to use mokanix to set up your own mobile data network. You can use
  our simple but powerful APIs to monitor and control data flow and add a private
  VPN for full security. And we offer access to multiple mobile networks on a single
  SIM for always-available connectivity. We look after all the difficult stuff with
  the mobile networks so you can spend your time where it matters: building the solutions
  you need.</p>'
