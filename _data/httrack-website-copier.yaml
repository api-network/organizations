name: HTTrack Website Copier
description: HTTrack is a free (GPL, libre/free software) and easy-to-use offline
  browser utility. It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet
  to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images,
  and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original
  site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the 'mirrored' website in
  your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing
  it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted
  downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system. WinHTTrack
  is the Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Seven/8 release of HTTrack, and WebHTTrack the Linux/Unix/BSD
  release.
