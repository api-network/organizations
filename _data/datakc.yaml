  <p>Crowdtilt allows groups to pool funds for objectives in a simple, social, and frictionless way online.</p>

  <p>We all love doing things as a group. Like with a lot of experiences, it&#8217;s not what you do ??? it&#8217;s the people you do it with that matters more.</p>

  <p>At Crowdtilt, we&#8217;re trying to make it easier for groups to do things together. Whether it&#8217;s a party-bus to the next Phish show or pooling money for a cause you know your close friends are passionate about ??? we just want to make that process of grouping those funds as easy as possible.</p>
