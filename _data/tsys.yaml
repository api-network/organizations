description: TSYS offers multiple secure payments solutions for its partners' cloud-based
  Point of Sale systems and E-Commerce sites. While TSYS' products are designed to
  keep cardholder data out of our partners' (and your merchants') environments, it's
  important to note that certain technical and operational requirements may still
  apply, and that attacks against your POS or E-Commerce site that may compromise
  cardholder data are still possible. Below are some best practices that many of our
  partners employ and can help protect your sites - and mitigate the damages
