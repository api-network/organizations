description: 'Almost everyone leaves digital traces of their personal data and identity
  on the internet. For example, when buying online or using social media. These activities
  are not always secure, and fraudsters are always looking for new ways to get hold
  of other people''s personal data. That is precisely why Digidentity was founded
  ten years ago: to improve the protection of internet users'' digital identity and
  to make their online lives safer.'
