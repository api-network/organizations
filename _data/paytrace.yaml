description: PayTrace began as an idea. The idea that payment systems could be better.
  Merchants didn't have to settle for mediocre gateways offering little to no support.
  It was possible to delight merchants with 5-star service and a system that was comprehensive,
  lowered processing costs, and increased security. Today, we live and breathe this
  idea. Innovation drives improvements to our systems while our team is committed
  to serving merchants and partners. At PayTrace, we are proud to be advancing payments
  one relationship at a time.
