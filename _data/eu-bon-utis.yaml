description: '<p>The EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy is a collection of open source
  tools and services which together cover all aspects of the taxonomic workflow. The
  workflow is grouped into the following areas: taxonomic editing; publishing of edited
  data; data storage and exchange; collections and specimens; descriptions; fieldwork;
  literature; and geography. At the heart of the Cybertaxonomy platform is the Common
  Data Model (CDM), a repository for every conceivable type of data produced by taxonomists
  in the course of their work, and the backend for most EDIT components.</p>'
