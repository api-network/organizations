name: Federal Emergency Management Agency
description: <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is an agency of the
  United States Department of Homeland Security, initially created by Presidential
  Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978 and implemented by two Executive Orders on April
  1, 1979. The agency's primary purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster
  that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local
  and state authorities. The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must
  declare a state of emergency and formally request from the president that FEMA and
  the federal government respond to the disaster.&nbsp;</p>
