description: <p>Istabai is an application that allows users to manage their home heating
  systems from anywhere with an internet connection. Users can set the service up
  simply by changing their radiator head and plugging in Istabai's internet cable.
  The Istabai mobile application and web solution will relay the current temperature
  to the user and allow them to regulate it as they like. The system can also be accessed
  and controlled programmatically via REST API. The Istabai website is provided in
  English, Russian, and Latvian.</p>
