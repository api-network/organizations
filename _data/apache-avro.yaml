name: Apache Avro
description: <p>Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro relies on schemas.
  When Avro data is read, the schema used when writing it is always present. This
  permits each datum to be written with no per-value overheads, making serialization
  both fast and small. This also facilitates use with dynamic, scripting languages,
  since data, together with its schema, is fully self-describing.</p>
