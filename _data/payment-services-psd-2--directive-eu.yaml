name: Payment services (PSD 2) - Directive (EU)
description: <p>The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2, Directive (EU) 2015/2366,
  which replaced the Payment Services Directive (PSD), Directive 2007/64/EC) is an
  EU Directive, administered by the European Commission (Directorate General Internal
  Market) to regulate payment services and payment service providers throughout the
  European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). The PSD directive's purpose
  was to increase pan-European competition and participation in the payments industry
  also from non-banks, and to provide for a level playing field by harmonizing consumer
  protection and the rights and obligations for payment providers and users. The key
  objectives of the PSD2 directive are creating a more integrated European payments
  market, making payments safer and more secure and protecting consumers.</p>
