name: Open Eligibility
description: <p>The Open Eligibility Project is a collaborative for a better human
  service taxonomy. The taxonomy is a simple way to categorize human services and
  human situations. With these common categories, we, as service providers, navigators,
  and people in need, can find human services quickly and easily. This is an API setup
  and operated by API Evangelist to support the evolution of the specification, and
  use across many different human services API projects.</p>
