name: Mecha CMS
description: "Mecha is a file-based CMS that survives on principle that a database-less
  site should be personal, portable, light and easy to be exported and backed up.
  That\u2019s why most of the projects associated with Mecha are created with personal
  natures and are dedicated to be used for personal purposes such as blog, journal
  and diary."
