description: <p>Giphy is a search engine for GIFs. Animated GIFs have existed for
  decades, but there was still no good way to browse and discover the best the web
  had to offer. And the vision for Giphy isn&rsquo;t really just about finding GIFs.
  It&rsquo;s a search engine today but soon you&rsquo;ll see it grow into a community,
  a platform with a host of features targeted at gif artists, enthusiasts, bloggers,
  and anyone generally looking to discover or create that next big meme.</p>
