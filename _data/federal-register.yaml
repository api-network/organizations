  official journal of the federal government of the United States that contains government
  agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.[1] It is published daily, except

  in the Federal Register are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and
  codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is updated annually.</p>
