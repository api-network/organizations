name: AWS Glacier
description: <p>Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost cloud
  storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. Customers can reliably
  store large or small amounts of data for as little as $0.004 per gigabyte per month,
  a significant savings compared to on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable
  for varying retrieval needs, Amazon Glacier provides three options for access to
  archives, from a few minutes to several hours.</p>
