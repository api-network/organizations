name: GSA Per Diem API
description: <p>Per Diem Rates are the allowed reimbursement rates for hotel stays
  and meals for federal travelers. Rates are set for each of the federal government's
  fiscal years (FY 2014 is October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014.) GSA is responsible
  for setting the rates in the continental United States. &nbsp;Many businesses and
  other organizations adopt these rates as well. GSA is making the rates available
  using the CKAN's Action API via Data.gov to allow software developers programmatic
  access the data and create innovative uses for it.</p>
