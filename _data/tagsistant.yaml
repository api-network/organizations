name: Tagsistant
description: Semantic filesystem for GNU/Linux and BSD. Use directories as tags, copy
  files inside, than search using the path as a query tool, like in &quot;tags/rock/AND/acoustic/OR/grunge/&quot;.
  Also you can tell Tagsistant that music includes rock and grounge, or let it do
  some autotagging using mime/types.
