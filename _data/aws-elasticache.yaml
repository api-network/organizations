name: AWS ElastiCache
description: <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy,
  operate, and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud. The service improves
  the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from
  fast, managed, in-memory data stores, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based
  databases. Amazon ElastiCache automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, reducing
  the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures and provides a resilient
  system that mitigates the risk of overloaded databases, which slow website and application
  load times. Through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides
  enhanced visibility into key performance metrics associated with your Redis or Memcached
  nodes.</p>
