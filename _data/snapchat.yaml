description: <p>Snapchat is the fastest way to share a moment with friends. You control
  how long your friends can view your message &ndash; simply set the timer up to ten
  seconds and send. They'll have that long to view your message and then it disappears
  forever. We&rsquo;ll let you know if they take a screenshot! Build relationships,
  collect points, and view your best friends. Snapchat is instantly fun and insanely
  playful. Show your friends how clever you can be and enjoy the lightness of being!</p>
