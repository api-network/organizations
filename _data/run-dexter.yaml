description: <p>Solve those annoying problems on the web. In simpler times, BASH scripts
  made repetitive tasks on your own computer easier to execute. But today, your data
  is spread across dozens of web services, protected by OAuth, and accessible only
  through service-specific APIs. Dexter brings the power of local scripting to the
  web, allowing you to build simple apps that link multiple services, run tasks, and
  get rid of headaches.</p>
