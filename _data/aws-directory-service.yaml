description: <p><span>AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Enterprise
  Edition), also known as AWS Microsoft AD, enables your directory-aware workloads
  and AWS resources to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. The Microsoft
  AD service is built on actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you
  to synchronize or replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud.
  You can use standard Active Directory administration tools and take advantage of
  built-in Active Directory features such as Group Policy, trusts, and single sign-on.
  With Microsoft AD, you can easily join&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon
  EC2</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/">Amazon
  RDS for SQL Server</a><span>&nbsp;instances to a domain, and use&nbsp;</span><a
  href="https://aws.amazon.com/enterprise-applications/">AWS Enterprise IT applications</a><span>&nbsp;such
  as&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/">Amazon WorkSpaces</a><span>&nbsp;with
  Active Directory users and groups.</span></p>
