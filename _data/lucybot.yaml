description: <p>At LucyBot, we believe APIs should be easy. We help API providers
  build developer portals to show off their API's functionality, automatically generating
  sample code in several different programming languages and frameworks. This increases
  API adoption, expands usage among existing users, and alleviates the burden of customer
  support.</p>
