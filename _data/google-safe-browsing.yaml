description: <p>The Safe Browsing APIs (v4) let your client applications check URLs
  against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Examples of unsafe
  web resources are social engineering sites (phishing and deceptive sites) and sites
  that host malware or unwanted software. Any URL found on a Safe Browsing list is
  considered unsafe.</p>
