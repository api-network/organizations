description: An escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates
  payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It
  helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account
  which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are met as overseen
  by the escrow company.
