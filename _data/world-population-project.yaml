name: World Population Project
description: <p>Population.io aims to make demography &ndash; the study of human populations
  &ndash; accessible to a wider audience. We believe that demographic data can play
  an important role in understanding the social and economic developments of our time.
  Our hope is that people from all walks of life, in all ages and across all countries
  will explore a new perspective of their own life and find their own place in the
  world of today and tomorrow.</p>
