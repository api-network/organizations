description: "The launch of the iPhone X brought along with it a revolutionary unlock
  feature, known to many as the facial recognition scanner. With the Face ID, the
  iPhone X users can unlock their phone by utilizing its front camera to scan their
  unique facial feature. This is a step up from the fingerprint sensor. While it does
  sound convenient for the users to unlock their phones, there have been some concerns
  especially voiced by privacy experts regarding the protection of privacy that the
  device itself provides. Of course, the Face ID prevents people from accessing your
  phone, but is the data of your facial features protected from going out from your
  device and falling into the wrong hands? Here, we will take a closer look at the
  storage of the data of your facial scan, as well as how Apple handles it in its
  latest smartphone. Before we even get into the issue, we should address whether
  the Face ID does provide adequate protection in the first place. Apple claims that
  the Face ID is secure, as it should be, and that touting internal data shows a very
  low chance (one in a million) that the phone will unlock with a different person's
  face. To unlock the phone, the device stores the user's face scan inside on a secure
  enclave[1]. That means your facial data remains inside the device. However, one
  cannot dismiss the possibility that app developers can, albeit limited, access that
  data. Here, some technology commentators are worried about who can have access to
  the sensor. One potential use of the sensor for advertisers, according to Geoffrey
  Fowler in his review for the Washington Post, is the fact that they can use the
  camera to determine exactly where the user is looking on the screen during their
  advertisements if you are looking at them at all. He also mentioned that the Apple's
  terms for app developers forbid them from accessing the camera without permission
  or use the face data for advertising. Moreover, Fowler pressed the Apple executives
  and saw one positive change: applications that use the face data are required to
  publish a privacy policy. However, how well that protects the user's privacy remains
  to be seen. Apple actually allows app developers to take certain facial data from
  the phone and store it on the developer's own server, as long as they ask the user
  for their permission, and not sell that data to third parties. Although the data
  access is limited, the app developers can capture a rough map of the user's face
  and numerous expressions. That means the app developers can and will know when you
  smile, blink, or raise an eyebrow.[2] According to the documentation about the face
  unlock system which Apple released to security researchers, the data of the user's
  face that is accessible to the developers cannot be used to unlock a phone. To unlock
  the phone, a mathematical representation of the face is required as opposed to the
  requirement of a visual map of the face[3]. At least, that means app developers
  cannot remotely unlock your phone and access your data. Still, the fact that the
  authentication data can be shared does not sit well with everyone. This is where
  the privacy protection becomes really questionable. By enabling app developers to
  store the user's rough facial data on their own server, just how well can Apple
  enforce their privacy protection rule upon those developers? After all, advertisers
  need the facial data to tell whether their advertisements are effective, or to simply
  study their target audience. Apple remains firm that they are sure that their enforcement
  tools, which are pre-publication reviews, audits of applications, and the threat
  of removing the app from the app store, are effective. The problem here is that
  Apple does not thoroughly review the source code of the applications, according
  to 2011 Congressional testimony from Bud Trible. Moreover, Apple relies instead
  on random spot checks or complaints, which is a very ineffective means of defense
  against privacy abuse. When it comes to privacy policies published by the application
  developer, it is long and complex, and it will most likely not be read by the users.
  Another means of enforcement is the threat of kicking apps out of the App Store.
  While it is true that Apple has a good record of holding developers accountable
  for their violations, the challenge here is the fact that Apple has to find them
  first, according to American Civil Liberties Union's Stanley. While these enforcement
  rules may seem strong on paper, in actuality, small application developers will
  most likely follow Apple's rules. Still, larger companies like Uber, have a record
  of breaking Apple's rules[4]. That brings Apple's enforcement mechanism into question.
  All-in-all, the introduction of the Face ID authentication system is, without a
  doubt, revolutionary in the race to smartphone supremacy. However, one should not
  dismiss the security flaws offered by new, and flashy technologies. Here, the user's
  privacy may not be as protected as they think. While Apple does have its defense
  mechanisms against privacy violations from application developers, their effectiveness
  remains to be seen. [1] [2][3] [4] \xA9 2018 by Privacyguard.net, an LiVenture.
