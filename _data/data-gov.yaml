description: <p>data.gov is a U.S. government website launched in late May 2009 by
  the then Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the United States, Vivek Kundra.
  According to its website, "The purpose of data.gov is to increase public access
  to high value, machine readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the
  Federal Government." The site seeks to become "a repository for all the information
  the government collects". The site would publish to the public any data that is
  not private or restricted for national security reasons.</p>
