description: <p>Leafly is the world&rsquo;s largest cannabis information resource,                  empowering
  people in legal cannabis markets to                  learn about the right products
  for their lifestyle and wellness needs,                  find those products safely
  and efficiently, and buy them from licensed                  and regulated dispensaries.
  Leafly was founded in 2010 as a destination to learn                 about the thousands
  of cannabis strains available to medical marijuana                 patients. Since
  then, the award-winning company has developed into an                 all-encompassing
  destination for medical marijuana patients, adult                 recreational consumers,
  advanced cannabis enthusiasts, and curious                 newcomers to cannabis,
  educating all types of consumers on which                 products are right for
  them and connecting them to the dispensaries                 that carry exactly
  what they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
