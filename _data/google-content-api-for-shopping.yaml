name: Google Content API for Shopping
description: '<p>API allowing retailers to manage their product feed content programmatically.
  &nbsp;Providing item-level data quality information: See if an item was disapproved
  because a landing page URL isn&rsquo;t working on a mobile device or if unique product
  identifiers are inaccurate. Faster pricing and availability updates: Ensure customers
  have the latest price-points and know what&rsquo;s in-stock before they click through
  to your site. More integration options: &nbsp;The newer API supports a broader choice
  of programming languages and data formats.</p>'
