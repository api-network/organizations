  to everyone. We focus on building cutting edge tools that can be integrated into
  existing apps cheaply and with minimal work. We work across various models, but
  our focus is on image processing deep learning. For a quick demo of what we can
  do, check out our Fast Demo Page. Our API has been used in a number of applications:
  to build an image transformation mobile app, to create an amazing photo booth, and
  to add a unique twist on custom printing.</p>'
