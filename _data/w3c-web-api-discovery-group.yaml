name: W3C Web API Discovery Group
description: <p>A group to develop a mechanism for the automatic discovery of WebAPIs,
  by extending the schema.org vocabulary. Increasingly, large online platforms and
  services provide one or more Web APIs for third-party developers. Moreover, many
  companies build WebAPIs as their primary product (Email API, SMS API, etc.). This
  has resulted in an explosion of the number of WebAPIs in recent years. Developers
  spend a significant amount of time searching for suitable WebAPIs to meet their
  needs. Our intention is to work closely with Schema.org to define a WebAPI-specific
  extension and promote usage of this extension among API owners. In the long run,
  our aim is to contribute this extension into the core Schema.org vocabulary. To
  achieve these goals we are seeking feedback and collaboration from API owners, DX
  specialists, API description language experts and maintainers of various API catalogs.</p>
