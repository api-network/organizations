description: "The U.S. Cluster Mapping Project is used by governments, economic developers,
  and businesses to understand and shape the competitive landscape for a wide range
  of industries.  These data are being put in the hands of local officials, who are
  using the information to make strategic investments, recruit new companies, and
  lay the groundwork for new industries.  Across the country, our cluster mapping
  tool gives us the ability to reinvent and modernize economic development strategies
  \u2013 all driven by open data"
