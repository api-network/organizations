description: All Unix, Linux and other Unix-like operating systems are families of
  computer operating systems derived from the original Unix System from AT&T Bell
  Laboratories. Today, the largest Unix descendent directly certified as UNIX is macOS
  by Apple. The original commercial Unix derivatives included HP-UX, AIX and SunOS,
  to name a few. The diversity and perceived incompatibility between various Unix
  systems led to the creation of interoperability standards including the Portable
  Operating System Interface (POSIX). We provide free Linux and UNIX shell scripting,
  system administration and other programming help.
