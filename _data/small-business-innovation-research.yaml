description: <p><span>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business
  Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are highly competitive programs that encourage
  domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development
  (R/R&amp;D) with the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based
  program, SBIR and STTR enable small businesses to explore their technological potential
  and provide the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified
  small businesses in the nation's R&amp;D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated,
  and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research
  and development needs.</span></p>
