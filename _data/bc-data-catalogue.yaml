description: <p>The BC Data catalogue helps users to find, understand and explore
  data. The catalogue also provides contact information so that data users can contact
  Data Custodians for additional information if required. DataBC manages the BC Data
  Catalogue software and infrastructure, and delivers user training and authorization
  management. Data, APIs and Applications registered and presented through the BC
  Data Catalogue are managed and provided by Data Custodians from across the broader
  public service. Each Data Custodian is typically a Director or Executive Director
  of an Organizational unit such as a Branch or Division.</p>
