description: "For a combined 88 years, Foundation Center and GuideStar each helped
  change the world by giving people the information they needed to do good. But the
  world faces growing challenges: polarization, climate change, technological revolution,
  and poverty and inequality. That\u2019s why we combined our talent, technology,
  data, and leadership to become a new organization, Candid. Now, it\u2019s easier
  than ever to get the information you need to create change."
