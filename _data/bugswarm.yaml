description: <p><span>Acquire data from and control embedded devices using JavaScript
  or plain old HTTP. Combine multiple resources together to create a swarm. Once a
  member of a swarm, a resource can communicate and share data with other resources
  in that swarm. Control the level of access a resource has to a swarm. Grant a resource
  permission to produce data, consume data, or do both. Invite another user's resources
  into your swarms and accept invitations to place your resources in somebody else's
  swarms. Share your data easily and securely.</span></p>
