description: <p>Open Banking is the secure way to give providers access to your financial
  information. It opens the way to new products and services that could help customers
  and small to medium-sized businesses get a better deal. It could also give you a
  more detailed understanding of your accounts, and help you find new ways to make
  the most of your money. Get ready for a world of apps and websites, where you can
  choose new financial products and services from providers regulated by the Financial
  Conduct Authority (FCA) and European equivalents.</p>
