  of information about audio recordings, including commercial releases, promotional
  releases, and bootleg or off-label releases. The Discogs servers, currently hosted
  under the domain name discogs.com, are owned by Zink Media, Inc., and are located

  releases, by 3.9 million artists, across over 743,000 labels, contributed from nearly
  238,000 contributor user accounts &ndash; with these figures constantly growing
