description: <p>Test your front-end against a real API. A hosted REST-API ready to
  respond to your AJAX requests. It might seem pretty weird to be sending your data
  to a 3rd party API, but I can assure you, Reqres does not store any of your data
  at all. Once you send it to us, we just send it straight back...and then it's gone!</p>
