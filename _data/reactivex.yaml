name: ReactiveX
description: <p>ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based
  programs by using observable sequences. It extends the observer pattern to support
  sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences
  together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level
  threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking
  I/O.</p>
