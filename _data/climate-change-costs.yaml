name: Climate Change Costs
description: <p>Are the benefits of using carbon greater than the cost of climate
  change? To answer this question, an independent organization called DARA created
  a report in September, 2012 studying the economic costs of climate change. Much
  has been said about the moral, political, and social costs of Climate Change, but
  with Climate Change caused disease, droughts, storms, habitat changes and more there's
  a clear economic $$ cost as well.</p>
