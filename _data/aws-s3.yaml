  <p>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and scale past trillions of objects worldwide.</p>
  <p>Customers use S3 as a bulk repository, or "data lake," for analytics; backup &amp; recovery; disaster recovery; and serverless computing. Many cloud-native applications even use S3 as primary storage.</p>
  <p>It's simple to move large volumes of data into or out of S3 with Amazon's&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-data-migration/">cloud data migration</a>&nbsp;options. Once data is stored in Amazon S3, it can be automatically tiered into lower cost, longer-term&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/">cloud storage</a>&nbsp;classes like S3 Standard - Infrequent Access and Amazon Glacier for archiving.</p>
