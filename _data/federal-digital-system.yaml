description: <p>The Federal Digital System (FDsys) replaces GPOAccess,[1] an information
  storage system to house electronic government documents with a modern information
  management system. FDsys authenticates, preserves and provides permanent public
  access to federal government documents. The system automates the collection, management
  and dissemination of electronic information from all three branches of the federal
  government. The goal is to have a complete historical record of all federal government
  documents from the founding of our nation to the present.[1] FDsys was named by
  Government Computer News as one of the best government Web sites.</p>
