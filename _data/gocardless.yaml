description: "GoCardless is on a mission to take the pain out of getting paid for
  businesses with recurring revenue. We\u2019ve created a global bank debit network,
  to rival credit and debit cards. On top of it, we\u2019ve built a platform designed
  and optimised for taking invoice, subscription, membership and instalment payments.
  We now process $10bn in transactions a year and we\u2019re proud to count 40,000
  businesses around the world as our customers, from small businesses to household
  names like Thomas Cook, TripAdvisor and the Guardian."
