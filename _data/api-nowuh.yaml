description: <p>Today we have an amazing amount of data being collected. As more and
  more of us are connecting our every move to the internet, API.nowuh attempts to
  show how much data is currently being collected for an average person with a fair
  amount of IoT devices. This project serves two purposes, and neither are to make
  you afraid of the future. This first purpose is simply awareness; it's always important
  to understand how much information on you is possibly out in the ether. The second
  is for whatever the heck you want. As I continue to build this out, more and more
  data points will become available. You're free to do whatever you want with it,
  go nuts. Anyone is able to use V1 of the API but your IP address may be blocked
  if suspicious activity is detected.</p>
