name: Visualizing Algorithms
description: '<p>Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize
  an algorithm, we don&rsquo;t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset.
  Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm
  visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better
  communicate. This is reason enough to study them. But algorithms are also a reminder
  that visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data. Visualization
  leverages the human visual system to augment human intellect: we can use it to better
  understand these important abstract processes, and perhaps other things, too.</p>'
