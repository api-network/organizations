description: <p>Data's true potential is limited by outdated barriers from an era
  when people, data, and impact were disconnected. These divisions prevent the vast
  majority of people from contributing to, and benefiting fully from, data as a resource.
  What would the world be like if everyone could use data to solve problems? Now is
  the right time to find out. If we work together, we can do far more with data by
  replacing needless barriers with meaningful connections.</p>
