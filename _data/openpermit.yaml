description: <p>Open Permit uses the internet to make the permitting process transparent
  by employing modern technology to define a set of open standards that allow a jurisdiction
  to publish information and interact with citizens and businesses through an electronic
  medium. This means that requirements and process details can be provided by jurisdictions
  in a machine readable and automated form consumable by all applications with access
  to the internet, eliminating paper based workflows. An open standards model also
  allows for multiple jurisdictions to follow the same best practice approaches, minimizing
  inconsistencies when citizens go to obtain a permit from one jurisdiction to the
  next. Open Permit is also about making the technology itself open so that applications
  can be built in a way that are interoperable and can be used to streamline automate
  and better visualize permitting.</p>
