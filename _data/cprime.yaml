description: Our solutions bridge the gap between process and technology, and focus
  on the teams who carry them out. Our Agile training and coaching address the fragmented
  way Agile and DevOps initiatives are implemented. Focusing on unifying teams and
  processes, we deliver an integrated approach that supports the software goals of
  any organization. We call this Software Services Lifecycle Management (SSLM).
