description: <p>Asterank is a scientific and economic database of over 600,000 asteroids.
  &nbsp;We've collected, computed, or inferred important data such as asteroid mass
  and composition from multiple scientific sources. With this information, we estimate
  the costs and rewards of mining asteroids. &nbsp;Details on orbits and basic physical
  parameters are sourced from the Minor Planet Center and NASA JPL. Composition data
  is based on spectral classification and size. Our calculations incorporate conclusions
  from multiple scientific publications in addition to cross-referencing known meteorite
  data.</p>
