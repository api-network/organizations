name: Pushpin
description: <p>Pushpin is a reverse proxy server that makes it easy to build realtime
  web services. What's unique about Pushpin is that its external interface is defined
  by whatever backend applications are running behind it. This makes it ideal for
  API creators, where control over the front-facing protocol is paramount. Think of
  Pushpin as the realtime equivalent of a transparent caching server like Varnish.</p>
