description: <p><span>Transparency Toolkit uses open data to watch the watchers and
  hold the powerful to account. We build free software to collect and analyze open
  data from a variety of sources. Then we work with investigative journalists and
  human rights organizations to turn that into useful, actionable knowledge. Currently,
  our primary focuses are investigating surveillance and human rights abuses.</span></p>
