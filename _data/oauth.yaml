description: <p>An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard
  method from web, mobile and desktop applications. OAuth is a way to get access to
  protected data from an application. It's safer and more secure than asking users
  to log in with passwords. Use OAuth to let application developers securely get access
  to your users' data without sharing their passwords.</p>
