description: <p>We verify the source of each session and validate that it was generated
  by humans in your network. Automated processes are whitelisted and anything remaining
  is malware. Unlike other solutions that rely on intelligence or signatures, our
  solution can detect and block zero-day malware and the most advanced persistent
  threats to date. Out of the box would have detected and prevented hacks such as
  ones to the DNC,OPM,Sony, and others. Metapacket automatically blocks malware and
  exploitation attempts including from unknown or zero-day threats and generates highly-focused
  and clear incident reports.</p>
