description: <p>Pinboard is a bookmarking website for introverted people in a hurry.
  The focus of the site is less on socializing, and more on speed and utility. Pinboard
  tries to offer useful features without getting in your way. My highest priority
  is keeping your data safe over the long term.</p>
