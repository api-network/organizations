  <p>PeekYou places the individual at the center of the Internet. For every public weblink, PeekYou tries to answer the question, &#8220;Who made it?&#8221; or, where applicable, &#8220;Whom is it about?&#8221; So far, we&#8217;ve answered those questions for a billion links and counting. Our patented technology analyzes content from over sixty social sites, news sources, homepages and blog platforms and identifies the actual people behind it, combining their scattered digital footprints into a comprehensive record of their online identity.</p>

  <p>Google calculates the likelihood of any link being associated to a keyword. PeekYou calculates the likelihood of any link being associated to an individual.</p>

  <p>The company was founded in 2006 by Michael Hussey and is headquartered in New York City.</p>
