name: RestFest
description: |-
  <p>REST Fest is an unconference developed by Mike Amundsen and Benjamin Young. Our objective is to give people interested in REST, Hypermedia APIs, crafting web service APIs, or any related topics a chance to get together in an informal setting to share ideas, trade stories, and show examples of current work. REST Fest is a unique blend of presentations and collaborative unconference goodness. The keynote sits directly in the middle of the conference schedule with hackday, workshop, session, talks, and 5-in-5 lightening talks surrounding it.</p>
  <p>The next RESTFest is September 26-27-29th, Greenville, SC.</p>
