description: <p>Postcode Anywhere is a UK-based company best known for its market-leading
  &lsquo;what&rsquo;s your postcode&rsquo; technology, used to quickly complete your
  address when buying online. &nbsp;It was established by Guy Mucklow and Jamie Turner
  in 2001. By seeing the internet value as a much more efficient information delivery
  medium than traditional methods - which typically involved burning data onto CDs
  and shipping out to the customer - Postcode Anywhere has turned the market upside
  down.</p>
