description: <p>OpenXC is a combination of open source hardware and software that
  lets you extend your vehicle with custom applications and pluggable modules. It
  uses standard, well-known tools to open up a wealth of data from the vehicle to
  developers. OpenXC is an API to your car - by installing a small hardware module
  to read and translate metrics from a car's internal network, the data becomes accessible
  from most Android applications using the OpenXC library. You can start making vehicle-aware
  applications that have better interfaces based on context, can minimize distraction
  while driving, are integrated with other connected services, and can offer you more
  insight into your car's operation.</p>
