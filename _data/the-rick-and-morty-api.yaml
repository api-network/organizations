name: The Rick and Morty API
description: The Rick and Morty API (or ShlaAPI) is a RESTful and GraphQL API based
  on the television show Rick and Morty. You will have access to about hundreds of
  characters, images, locations and episodes. We are still gathering data, because
  as you probably know, there are trillions of characters and locations. The Rick
  and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show.
