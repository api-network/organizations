  href="https://aws.amazon.com/data-warehouse/" target="_blank">data warehouse</a><span>&nbsp;that
  makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using your existing
  business intelligence tools. Start small for $0.25 per hour with no commitments
  and scale to petabytes for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth the cost
  of traditional solutions. Customers typically see 3x compression, reducing their
  costs to $333 per uncompressed terabyte per year.</span></p>
