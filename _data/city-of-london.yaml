description: <p>The London Datastore has been created by the Greater London Authority
  (GLA) as an innovation towards freeing London&rsquo;s data. We want citizens to
  be able access the data that the GLA and other public sector organisations hold,
  and to use that data however they see fit &ndash; free of charge. The GLA is committed
  to influencing and cajoling other public sector organisations into releasing their
  data here too.</p>
