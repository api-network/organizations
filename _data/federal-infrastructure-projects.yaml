description: <p><span>To achieve that objective, our Federal permitting and review
  processes must provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path for both
  project sponsors and affected communities. They must ensure that agencies set and
  adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of reviews, set clear permitting
  performance goals, and track progress against those goals. They must encourage early
  collaboration among agencies, project sponsors, and affected stakeholders in order
  to incorporate and address their interests and minimize delays.</span></p>
