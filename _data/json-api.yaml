description: '<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever argued with your team about the way your JSON
  responses should be formatted, JSON:API can be your anti-bikeshedding tool. By following
  shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized
  tooling, and focus on what matters: your application. Clients built around JSON:API
  are able to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses,
  sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.</p>'
