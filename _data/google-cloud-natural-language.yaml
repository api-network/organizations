name: Google Cloud Natural Language
description: <p>Google Cloud Natural Language API reveals the structure and meaning
  of text by offering powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST API.
  You can use it to extract information about people, places, events and much more,
  mentioned in text documents, news articles or blog posts. You can use it to understand
  sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from customer conversations
  happening in a call center or a messaging app. You can analyze text uploaded in
  your request or integrate with your document storage on Google Cloud Storage.</p>
