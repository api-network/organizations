description: <p>The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552, is a federal
  freedom of information law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously
  unreleased information and documents controlled by the United States government.
  The Act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure
  procedures and grants nine exemptions to the statute. It was originally signed into
  law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, despite his misgivings, on July 4, 1966, and
  went into effect the following year.</p>
