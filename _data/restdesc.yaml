description: '<p>Semantic descriptions for hypermedia APIs. RESTdesc allows you to
  capture the functionality of hypermedia APIs, so automated agents can use them.
  Despite their powerful capabilities, RESTdesc descriptions are easy to master. Description
  is not a goal in itself: you want your API to be used. See how RESTdesc opens up
  your API for discovery, based on its functional characteristics.</p>'
