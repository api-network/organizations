description: <p>PDFUnicorn is a web service for creating PDF files. PDF files can
  be created directly from source documents, or from data applied to custom templates.
  The markup language is intentionally simple to allow you to start creating templates
  and documents as quickly and easily as possible. Document content is securely sent
  from your server to ours enabling private customer text and images to be included
  without allowing remote access to your server and content. Document images can be
  uploaded at print quality resolutions to create the best looking documents possible.</p>
