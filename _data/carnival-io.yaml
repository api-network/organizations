description: <p>We founded the world's first iPhone app company in 2007, leading strategy
  and app development more than 120 apps for Fortune 500 brands. With 15x No.1 apps
  under our belt, we knew we had found the secret to keeping mobile communities engaged.
  In January 2014, we launched Carnival Mobile Marketing Suite to give brands and
  their agencies innovative technology to keep up with "always on" mobile audiences.</p>
