name: University of Virginia School of Medicine
description: <p>The University of Virginia School of Medicine only has the one research
  faculty directory API, but is enough of a start that I think it is worthy of recording.
  I will keep looking for other APIs that emerge at the school, and see if it expands
  beyond just this one API.</p>
