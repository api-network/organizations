name: AWS Service Catalog
description: <p><span>AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage
  catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. These IT services can
  include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases
  to complete multi-tier application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you
  to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services, and helps you achieve consistent
  governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly
  deploy only the approved IT services they need.</span></p>
