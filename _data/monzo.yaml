description: <p>It's time for a bank that makes life easier not harder. A bank that
  belongs on our smartphone, not on the high street. A bank that keeps us informed
  and in control, rather than trying to catch us out with fees and charges. It's time
  for a new kind of bank. It's time for Monzo!</p>
