name: Dutch Schools
description: <p>The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public
  bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However,
  data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is
  not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult.
  The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to
  data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities
  with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and
  Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology,
  such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx
  for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval.
  Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative
  aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with &ldquo;regular&rdquo;
  geocoding.</p>
