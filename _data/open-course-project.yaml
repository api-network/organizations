description: <p>The Open in Open Course Project means devotion to free information
  and Open Source technologies. The data that is compiled to service this website
  is regularly extracted directly from various CNU websites, but it's provided centrally
  using RESTful API standards to any interested students or third parties. If you
  are creating your own service or even a personal application using course, term,
  or instructor data, you are welcomed to use the API detailed on this page. General
  API endpoints are keyless and anonymous for now. If you're interested in using it
  for your projects, please don't abuse it. Otherwise I'll have to buy a bike lock.</p>
