description: <p>Mockaroo lets you generate up to 1,000 rows of realistic test data
  in CSV, JSON, SQL, and Excel formats. &nbsp;If you're developing an application,
  you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely simulate
  a production environment. In production, you'll have an army of users banging away
  at your app and filling your database with data, which puts stress on your code.
  If you're hand-entering data into a test environment one record at a time using
  the UI, you're never going to build up the volume and variety of data that your
  app will accumulate in a few days in production. Worse, the data you enter will
  be biased towards your own usage patterns and won't match real-world usage, leaving
  important bugs undiscovered.</p>
