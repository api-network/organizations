description: <p>DataMade is a civic technology company. We build open source technology
  using open data to empower journalists, researchers, governments and advocacy organizations.
  DataMade was born out of Chicago's Open Government community. In 2011, Derek and
  Forest started working on civic technology as volunteers of Open City. At nights
  and over weekends, they've helped make civic apps like Chicago Lobbyists, Clear
  Streets, and Second City Zoning.</p>
