name: OWASP API Security Project
description: <p>This project is designed to address the ever-increasing number of
  organizations that are deploying potentially sensitive APIs as part of their software
  offerings. These APIs are used for internal tasks and to interface with third parties.
  Unfortunately, many APIs do not undergo the rigorous security testing that would
  render them secure from attack.</p>
