description: <p>REST Fest is an unconference developed by Mike Amundsen and Benjamin
  Young. Our objective is to give people interested in REST, Hypermedia APIs, crafting
  web service APIs, or any related topics a chance to get together in an informal
  setting to share ideas, trade stories, and show examples of current work.</p>
