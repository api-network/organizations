description: <p>Writing data models can be tedious and boring. These are the main
  reasons why most of the API machine-readable documentations don't contain proper
  definitions for their data models. Most of the times they don't even have a definition.
  We found that your business data models are not so different from the rest of the
  companies, so why should we be writing these models over and over again? Let's share!</p>
