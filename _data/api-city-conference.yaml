  <p>API City Conference is a non-profit community event that brings together a diverse set of developers and business people to network and learn about APIs and the business value they can bring to you and your company. With a focus on diversity and accessibility, our 3 track conference creates an open event where everyone is welcome.</p>
  <p>Our 2018 event is being held at the Kitsap Conference Center from October 3rd - October 4th. The venue is located on the waterfront in Bremerton, WA and just one block from the ferry terminal. We are expecting 400 attendees this year. In addition to a great line-up of speakers, we will be providing live captioning in the main room for people hard of hearing, and a Women &amp; Non-Binary luncheon event. We hope you can join us for our inaugural event this Fall!</p>
