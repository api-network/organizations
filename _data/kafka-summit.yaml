name: Kafka Summit
description: <p>As streaming platforms become central to data strategies, companies
  both small and large are re-thinking their architecture with real-time context at
  the forefront. Monoliths are evolving into Microservices. Datacenters are moving
  to the cloud. What was once a &lsquo;batch&rsquo; mindset is quickly being replaced
  with stream processing as the demands of the business impose more and more real-time
  requirements on developers and architects. This revolution is transforming industries.
  What started at companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Netflix and Yelp has made its way
  to countless others in a variety of sectors. Today, thousands of companies across
  the globe build their businesses on top of Apache Kafka&reg;. The developers responsible
  for this revolution need a place to share their experiences on this journey. Kafka
  Summit is the premier event for data architects, engineers, devops professionals,
  and developers who want to learn about streaming data. It brings the Apache Kafka
  community together to share best practices, write code, and discuss the future of
  streaming technologies.</p>
