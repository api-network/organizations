description: <p>Eagle Eye Networks was created to make video security easier for all
  of us. Camera systems have traditionally been pretty complex, challenging for most
  people to manage, and costly. We are bringing the latest modern web and cloud technologies
  to make cameras easier to use, more accessible, and more robust. We believe that
  by doing this we will expand the applications. We eliminate a tremendous amount
  of headache by putting everything in the cloud where we can take care of it and
  you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
