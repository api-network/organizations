name: BC Geographical Names
description: <p>Geographical names are more than labels on maps and road signs. They
  can reveal patterns of settlement, exploration and migration, and mirror outside
  influences to our history - aspects of the heritage and promise of an area that
  might otherwise be overlooked or forgotten by visitors and later generations.</p>
