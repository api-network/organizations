description: <p>arate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation,
  mocks and performance-testing into a single, unified framework. The BDD syntax popularized
  by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Besides powerful
  JSON &amp; XML assertions, you can run tests in parallel for speed - which is critical
  for HTTP API testing.</p>
