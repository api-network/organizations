description: <p><span>JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for
  humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and
  provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal
  data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases
  such as Apache CouchDB and MongoDB.</span></p>
