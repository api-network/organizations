description: <p>DroneTracker is a multi-sensor system for the detection of modern
  civilian drones. The intelligent merging of different sensor systems makes it possible
  to reliably detect drones within a radius of 1km, to reliably identify and trigger
  an alarm. The advanced technology of the Drone Trackers allows the detection of
  civilian drones during the day and night and is completely independent of the noise
  emission. The area to be monitored can be extended by an interaction of several
  Drone Tracker. Its rugged design protects the Drone Tracker from environmental influences
  and thus ensures maintenance-free use over a long period of time.</p>
