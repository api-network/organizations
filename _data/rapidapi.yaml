description: <p>RapidAPI is the world&rsquo;s largest API marketplace. RapidAPI lets
  you visualize all your apps&rsquo; APIs, and gives you real-time metrics on their
  stability. There are millions of software programs out there and they&rsquo;re reshaping
  every aspect of our lives. We believe that they can get exponentially better by
  sharing data and functionality with each other. APIs are the language that software
  uses to communicate and connect. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why we love APIs.</p>
