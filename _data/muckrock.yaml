description: <p>MuckRock is a collaborative news site that brings together journalists,
  researchers, activists, and regular citizens to request, analyze &amp; share government
  documents, making politics more transparent and democracies more informed. The site
  provides a repository of hundreds of thousands of pages of original government materials,
  information on how to file requests, and tools to make the requesting process easier.
  In addition, MuckRock staff and outside contributors do original reporting and analysis
  of many of the documents received through the site. MuckRock's unique form of investigative
  and accountability journalism has been recognized by the Sunlight Foundation, The
  Freedom of the Press Foundation, and hundreds of local and national news outlets
  for its groundbreaking work in areas such as government spending, surveillance,
  and public safety.</p>
