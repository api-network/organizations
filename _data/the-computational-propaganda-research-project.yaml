name: The Computational Propaganda Research Project
description: <p>The Computational Propaganda Research Project (COMPROP) investigates
  the interaction of algorithms, automation and politics. This work includes analysis
  of how tools like social media bots are used to manipulate public opinion by amplifying
  or repressing political content, disinformation, hate speech, and junk news. We
  use perspectives from organizational sociology, human computer interaction, communication,
  information science, and political science to interpret and analyze the evidence
  we are gathering. Our project is based at the Oxford Internet Institute, University
  of Oxford.</p>
