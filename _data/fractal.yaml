description: <p>Fractal provides a presentation and transformation layer for complex
  data output, the like found in RESTful APIs, and works really well with JSON. Think
  of this as a view layer for your JSON/YAML/etc. When building an API it is common
  for people to just grab stuff from the database and pass it to json_encode(). This
  might be passable for &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; APIs but if they are in use by the public,
  or used by mobile applications then this will quickly lead to inconsistent output.</p>
