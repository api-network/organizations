description: <p><span>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's (HMH) Developer Portal is an HMH
  Labs initiative to expose the HMH APIs to others, including customers and third
  party developers. This creates an exciting opportunity for developers to build solutions
  that are compatible with those that our customers already know and trust. Initially,
  the APIs will connect with a sandbox environment and, down the road, with the rich
  and diverse world of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's offerings. Ultimately, our goal
  is to provide greater opportunities for interoperability and a seamless user experience
  for teachers, students and parents.</span></p>
