description: <p>Cloud Translation API provides a simple programmatic interface for
  translating an arbitrary string into any supported language. Translation API is
  highly responsive, so websites and applications can integrate with Translation API
  for fast, dynamic translation of source text from the source language to a target
  language (e.g., French to English). Language detection is also available In cases
  where the source language is unknown. The underlying technology pushes the boundary
  of Machine Translation and is updated constantly to seamlessly improve translations
  and introduce new languages and language pairs.</p>
