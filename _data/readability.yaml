description: <p>Readability is a free/pay reading platform that delivers a great reading
  experience and provides a model where your reading activity can directly compensate
  publishers and writers. Readability started off as a simple, Javascript-based reading
  tool that turned any web page into a customizable reading view. It was released
  by Arc90 (as an Arc90 Lab experiment), a New York City based design and technology
  shop, back in early 2009.</p>
