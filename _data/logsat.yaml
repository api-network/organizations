description: Spam Filter ISP is an Anti-spam server software for Windows that acts
  as a gateway/proxy to your existing SMTP server (MTA). Spam Filter filters email
  based on MAPS RBL and DNS based ORBS and SURBL blacklists, Greylisting, Bayesian
  statistical filtering and SPF filters. An antivirus plugin is available for anti
  virus support. A web interface for end-user access to the spam quarantine is available.
