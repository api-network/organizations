description: <p>Hitch is a single platform to help API owners engage with and grow
  their API community. Our clients show striking similarities in the challenges they
  face in building integrated and sustainable developer platforms. API providers still
  struggle to make sure their platform is visible to the right audience. Once found,
  access is inconsistent and cumbersome and even after onboarding, key engagement
  tools are seldom available. We have put together a single solution that covers these
  three key areas.</p>
