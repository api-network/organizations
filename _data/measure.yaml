description: <p>Measure operates turnkey drone solutions to deliver cost-effective
  actionable data to enterprise customers. Measure was founded specifically to help
  customers avoid the capital expense and operating risks of establishing their own
  drone programs and to purchase drone support in a way which better fits their operations
  and cost profiles. In a market largely comprised of manufacturers, Measure is the
  model for how drone services will develop and grow in the future.</p>
