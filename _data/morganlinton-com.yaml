  This week NamesCon has been in the news quite a bit as the Domain Industry''s biggest
  show gets ready to kick off in Austin. A few things to note this week - Alan Dunn,
  industry veteran and a good buddy of mine launched a new podcast on DomainStories.com.
  I''m really excited about this podcast, Alan has some great stories and this will
  be definitely be on my regular podcast rotation. Go Daddy updated their logo, and
  FWIW, I like it! Two articles were written with Austin tips, I''ve included them
  below. If you haven''t been to Austin before, or if its been a while, I''d recommend
  giving these a read. I''ll be putting out a post with some tips as well since I
  lived in Austin for three years and ended up with some favorite spots that I''m
  excited to share with all of you. On the domain sales side, Uniregistry''s sales
  were topped by a two-word .COM, RentPower.com and DomainGang shared an interesting
  post about the sale of NanoSleeve.com that''s definitely worth a read. Okay, enough
  from me - onto the news! Below are the stories from around the domain investing
  world that caught my eye this week, enjoy! 20-Year Industry Pro Alan Dunn Launches
