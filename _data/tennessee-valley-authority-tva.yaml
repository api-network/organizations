name: Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
description: <p>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a federally owned corporation
  in the United States created by congressional charter on May 18, 1933, to provide
  navigation, flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing, and
  economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region particularly affected by
  the Great Depression. Senator George W. Norris (R-Nebraska) was a strong sponsor
  of this project. TVA was envisioned not only as a provider, but also as a regional
  economic development agency that would use federal experts and rural electrification
  to help modernize the rural region's economy and society.</p>
