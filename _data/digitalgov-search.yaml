name: DigitalGov Search
description: <p>1,500 government websites currently use DigitalGov Search to power
  their search box. It would be impossible to match the value of GSA's DigitalGov
  Search service by procuring, building, and configuring a custom solution ourselves.
  With the combination of a very feature-rich search service and knowledgable staff,
  this is by far the best search tool ever.</p>
