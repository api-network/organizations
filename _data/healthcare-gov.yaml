name: Healthcare.gov
description: <p>HealthCare.gov is a health insurance exchange website operated under
  the United States federal government under the provisions of the Patient Protection
  and Affordable Care Act (ACA, often known as 'Obamacare'), designed to serve the
  residents of the thirty-six U.S. states that opted not to create their own state
  exchanges. The exchange facilitates the sale of private health insurance plans to
  residents of the United States[2] and offers subsidies to those who earn less than
  four times the federal poverty line. The website also assists those persons who
  are eligible to sign up for Medicaid, and has a separate marketplace for small businesses.</p>
